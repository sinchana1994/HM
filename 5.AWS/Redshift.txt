Redshift is focused on batch processing and analysis of large datasets for data warehousing and business intelligence purposes. 
On the other hand, Kinesis is designed for real-time streaming data ingestion, processing, and analytics. The choice between Redshift and Kinesis depends 
on your specific use case and whether you require real-time streaming analytics or batch-oriented data warehousing and analysis. In some cases, both 
services can be used together in an integrated data processing pipeline, with Kinesis handling real-time data ingestion and preprocessing, and Redshift 
performing deeper analysis and reporting on the processed data


-It is also called as a data warehouse service used for collecting and storeing the data.
-Comparitively redshift costs less than other cloud data warehouse services
-It is high performance, low cost, scalable, highly available and highly flexible as snap shots can be created and redshift cluster from that snapshot also 
simple migration availale.

-Client application will reacts with leader node using JDBC (Java data based connectivity-Using this, we can monitor the connections from other clint 
application) and ODBC (Open data based connectivity- Allows to interact with the live/irct data base of the amazon redshift).
-One leader node can have multiple compute nodes. Leader node communicates with the client application and the compute node.Cluster is the group of 
compute nodes. These nodes gather to a group called a data warehouse cluster.
-Compute nodes are catogorized into slices which will have allowted with specified memory. Node slices work parallely which makes redshift the fastest 
dataware house compared to others.

-Redshift has column storage and compression
-Data in column storage is stored in the form of column so that when the query is run, the data is pull out of the column for a quiker output.

Steps to create redshift
1. Create iam role for amazon redshift
2. Launch a sample amazon redshift cluster 
3. Authorize access to cluster
4. Connect to sample cluster and run queries
5.
