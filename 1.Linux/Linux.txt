*Linux file structure

-In Linux, the command "cd /" is used to change the current working directory to the root directory of the file system. 
-The root directory is the top-level directory in the file system hierarchy, and all other directories and files are located beneath it.
-When you execute the command "cd /", you are essentially navigating to the root of the file system. 
-This means that you can access any directory or file in the file system from this location.
- / consists of bin  boot  dev  etc  home  lib  lib64  local  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var directories.
1. /bin
	-It consists of the binaries and executables
2. /sbin
	-It consists of system binaries which will be executed by the root users only.
3. /lib

4. /etc
	-It is for the editable text configuration
5. /home
	-As linux supports multiple users, the user list will be store here.
6. /dev
	-Stands for device files
7. /boot
	-It consists of the files needed to boot the system
8. /opt
	-It consists of optional or the add on software
9. /var
	-It contains variable files which will change as the operating system is being used. Like logs and chache files

-In Linux, the tilde symbol (~) represents the home directory of the current user.
-Note that the tilde symbol is a shorthand for the current user's home directory, so it may be different for different users on the same system.
